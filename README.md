# Datasets
I picked an inbuilt data set in python and and performed an explanatory data analysis.
The analysis met the following criteria:

1) I performed checks to determine quality of the data (missing values, outliers, etc.) 


2) Description of the data: 

How big it is (number of observations, variables), number of numeric variables it contains, description of the variables, I also listed down the missing values and duplicate rows.

I also computed summary statistics (mean, median, mode, standard deviation, variance, range).
I picked the "sunspots" dataset which was inbuilt with anaconda (a distribution of python).
